              Full-stack Web Development is a relatively new field to me, but
              fits as a useful natural progression of my C++/C# background and
              skill set. Front-end work with html, css and js was something that
              I took a keen interest in in my teens and I have since revisited
              it.

              I'm currently working on developing my skills and would love the

              for <b>Junior roles</b> preferably with training or CPD schemes in

              Making games is one of the main reasons I became a software
              developer in the first place. Ever since being a child I have
              always enjoyed playing games, but as I've grown up it has become
              so much more than that.
            </p>
            <p>
              I always tend to gravitate towards the sandbox genre. The reason
              for this, I found, is intrinsically linked to my desire to create.
              Playing games just wasn't enough for me. I got so much more
              enjoyment out of building experiences for other people within the
              confines of these games, that one day I just turned around and
              said, "Why don't <b>I</b> just make a game?"
            </p>
            <p>
              I have spent the past few years teaching myself to program and
              building games and I'm now looking for work in the industry.

                <p>
                  In August 2012, I was awarded my Bachelors in Mathematics.
                  Maths was and is one of my favourite academic fields. My love
                  for programming and games development is made strongerby my
                  deep understanding of mathematics and the transferrable skills
                  that it has taught me.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Problem solving, analytical thinking and rigour are the
                  cornerstones of maths, and they align perfectly with the
                  problems we face every day in programming.

                <p>
                  In August 2014, I was awarded my PGCE with QTS. Going into a
                  teaching career after completing an academic degree like
                  Mathematics felt like a really natural progression. I don't
                  regret the choice of trying out the career, I have always
                  enjoyed learning and teaching and felt like it was almost my
                  duty to pass on my love of the subject to younger generations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Training to teach was one of the most challenging points in my
                  personal development. I was always quite shy and reserved,
                  teaching elevated me and taught me the value of clear and
                  effective communication. It gave me many experiences in how to
                  target specific audiences and tailor their experience to
                  produce top quality results.

                <h4>Maths Curriculum Tutor</h4>
                <p>
                  As a curriculum tutor, I continued expanding my teaching
                  career. My role was in both a teaching and support capacity. I
                  taught several classes of all ranges of abilities. I also
                  worked closely with Special Educational Needs (SEN) students.
                  These experiences were a rollercoaster for me and no two days
                  were ever the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I spent a lot of time developing student and colleague
                  friendly resources. Teaching always demands that you put the
                  students at the centre of everything you do and taught me many
                  transferrable skills about analysis, targetting and building
                  professional working relationships of trust and security.

                  C++ Game Engine Developer & Game Artist (Personal Project)
                </h4>
                <p>
                  In August 2015, I resigned from the curriculum tutor position
                  as I felt that a teaching career was not for me. I took some
                  time to decide on what I wanted to pursue and decided that my
                  passion lied/lies in programming and games development. As I
                  had only amateur experience I decided to invest time in myself
                  to develop my skillset whilst simultaneously acting as a full
                  time carer for my mum. I decided to build my own C++ Game
                  Engine from the ground up as a way to teach myself core skills
                  in programming and games development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Along the way, I taught myself how every facet of game
                  development works. From graphics and shaders to AI and
                  physics. It was the perfect way for me to apply my
                  mathematical background by combining it with a lifelong
                  passion for games.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I also took it as an opportunity to pursue my artistic side. I
                  taught myself numerous artistic tools alongside my programming
                  development. I focused mainly on 3D work in blender and
                  texturing using photoshop and krita, but also digital painting
                  and concept art.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The game engine is closed-source but I have screenshots and
                  code examples of some of the things that I developed and
                  learnt with this project.

                <h4>
                  C# Unity Game Developer & Game Artist (Personal Project)
                </h4>
                <p>
                  After working on my game engine for a few years, I developed a
                  vast skillset across a broad rangeof game development topics,
                  but unfortunately, whilst my game engine is functional and
                  working I had neglected to build an actual "game" with it
                  (although that was always the idea.) It was at this point that
                  I looked for alternative ways to prototype my game and to test
                  the product idea. It was then when I came across Unity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I fell straight into Unity head-first and have immersed myself
                  in it ever since. Unity came to me naturally, all of the
                  knowledge of how game engines are built from the ground up
                  made it incredibly easy for me to pick it up. I started with
                  some of their simple tutorial projects but I am now working on
                  my planned 3D Action RPG which is currently dubbed - Project
                  Arclight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The game is still in-development but will continue as a hobby
                  project, whilst I seek employment. The project is closed
                  source, so just like the above project, I have included
                  screenshots, code samples and written notes on the topics I
                  have studied.
