                            <h4>Achieved Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Mathematics (2:1) - University of Manchester</h4>
                            <p>
                                    In August 2012, I was awarded my Bachelors in Mathematics. Maths was and is one of my 
                                    favourite academic fields. My love for programming and games development is made stronger
                                    by my deep understanding of mathematics and the transferrable skills that it has taught me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    Problem solving, analytical thinking and rigour are the cornerstones of maths, and they
                                    align perfectly with the problems we face every day in programming.

                            <h4>Achieved PGCE Secondary Education (Maths) - Manchester Metropolitan University</h4>
                            <p>
                                In August 2014, I was awarded my PGCE with QTS. Going into a teaching career after completing
                                an academic degree like Mathematics felt like a really natural progression.
                                I don't regret the choice of trying out the career, I have always enjoyed learning and teaching
                                and felt like it was almost my duty to pass on my love of the subject to younger generations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Training to teach was one of the most challenging points in my personal development. I was always
                                quite shy and reserved, teaching elevated me and taught me the value of clear and effective 
                                communication. It gave me many experiences in how to target specific audiences and tailor 
                                their experience to produce top quality results.

                            <h4>Maths Curriculum Tutor</h4>
                            <p>
                                As a curriculum tutor I continued down expanding my teaching career. My role was in both a teaching
                                and support capacity whilst at the school. I taught several classes of all abilities. I also worked
                                closely with Special Educational Needs (SEN) students. These experiences were a rollercoaster for me
                                and no two days were ever the same. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I spent a lot of time developing student and colleague friendly resources. Teaching always demands
                                that you put the students at the centre of everything you do and taught me many transferrable skills
                                about analysis, targetting and building professional working relationships of trust and security.

                            <p>
                                In August 2015 I resigned from the curriculum tutor position as I felt that a teaching career was not 
                                for me. I took some time to decide on what I wanted to pursue and decided that my passion lied/lies in 
                                programming and games development. As I had only amateur experience I decided to invest time in myself 
                                to develop my skillset whilst simultaneously acting as a full time carer for my mum. I decided to build 
                                my own C++ Game Engine from the ground up as a way to teach myself core skills in programming and games 
                                development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Along the way the way I taught myself how every facet of game development works. From graphics and shaders
                                to AI and physics. It was the perfect way for me to apply my mathematical background by combining it
                                with a lifelong passion for games.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                I also took it as an opportunity to pursue my artistic side. I taught myself numerous artistic tools
                                alongside my programming development. With a strong focus on 3D work in blender and texturing using
                                photoshop and krita but also digital painting and concept art.
                            </p>

                                The game engine is closed-source but I have screenshots and code examples of some of the things that I
                                developed and learnt with this project.

                            <h4>C# Unity Game Developer & Game Artist (Personal Project)</h4>
                            <p>
                                After working on my game engine for a few years, I developed a vast skillset across a broad range
                                of game development topics, but unfortunately, whilst my game engine is functional and working I had
                                neglected to build an actual "game" with it (although that was always the idea.) It was at this point 
                                that I looked for alternative ways to prototype my game and to test the product idea. It was then when
                                I came across Unity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I fell straight into Unity head-first and have immersed myself in it ever since. Unity came to me naturally,
                                all of the knowledge of how game engines are built from the ground up made it incredibly easy for me to 
                                pick it up. I started with some of their simple tutorial projects but I am now working on my planned
                                3D Action RPG which is currently dubbed - Project Arclight.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The game is still in-development but will continue as a hobby project, whilst I seek employment.
                                The project is closed source, so just like the above project, I have included screenshots, code samples
                                and written notes on the topics I have studied.
