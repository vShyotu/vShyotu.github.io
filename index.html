          <p>Full-stack Web Development is a relatively new field to me, but fits as a useful natural progression of my C++/C# background and skill set. Front-end work with html, css and js was something that I took a keen interest in in my teens and I have since revisited it. </p>
          <p>I'm currently working on developing my skills and would love the opportunity to work and grow in this field. I'm current looking for <b>Junior roles</b> preferably with training or CPD schemes in place. I'm keen to develop and hopefully become a valued member in your team!</p>

          <p> Making games is one of the main reasons I became a software developer in the first place. Ever since being a child I have always enjoyed playing games, but as I've grown up it has become so much more than that. </p>
          <p> I always tend to gravitate towards the sandbox genre. The reason for this, I found, is intrinsically linked to my desire to create. Playing games just wasn't enough for me. I got so much more enjoyment out of building experiences for other people within the confines of these games, that one day I just turned around and said, "Why don't <b>I</b> just make a game?" </p>
          <p> I have spent the past few years teaching myself to program and building games and I'm now looking for work in the industry. </p>

              <h4>Achieved Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Mathematics (2:1) - University of Manchester</h4>
              <p> In August 2012, I was awarded my Bachelors in Mathematics. Maths was and is one of my favourite academic fields. My love for programming and games development is made strongerby my deep understanding of mathematics and the transferrable skills that it has taught me. </p>
              <p> Problem solving, analytical thinking and rigour are the cornerstones of maths, and they align perfectly with the problems we face every day in programming. </p>

              <h4>Achieved PGCE Secondary Education (Maths) - Manchester Metropolitan University</h4>
              <p> In August 2014, I was awarded my PGCE with QTS. Going into a teaching career after completing an academic degree like Mathematics felt like a really natural progression. I don't regret the choice of trying out the career, I have always enjoyed learning and teaching and felt like it was almost my duty to pass on my love of the subject to younger generations. </p>
              <p> Training to teach was one of the most challenging points in my personal development. I was always quite shy and reserved, teaching elevated me and taught me the value of clear and effective communication. It gave me many experiences in how to target specific audiences and tailor their experience to produce top quality results. </p>

              <h4>Maths Curriculum Tutor</h4>
              <p> As a curriculum tutor, I continued expanding my teaching career. My role was in both a teaching and support capacity. I taught several classes of all ranges of abilities. I also worked closely with Special Educational Needs (SEN) students. These experiences were a rollercoaster for me and no two days were ever the same. </p>
              <p> I spent a lot of time developing student and colleague friendly resources. Teaching always demands that you put the students at the centre of everything you do and taught me many transferrable skills about analysis, targetting and building professional working relationships of trust and security. </p>

              <h2>September 2015 - August 2018</h2>
              <h4>C++ Game Engine Developer & Game Artist (Personal Project)</h4>
              <p>In August 2015, I resigned from the curriculum tutor position as I felt that a teaching career was not for me. I took some time to decide on what I wanted to pursue and decided that my passion lied/lies in programming and games development. As I had only amateur experience I decided to invest time in myself to develop my skillset whilst simultaneously acting as a full time carer for my mum. I decided to build my own C++ Game Engine from the ground up as a way to teach myself core skills in programming and games development.</p>
              <p>Along the way, I taught myself how every facet of game development works. From graphics and shaders to AI and physics. It was the perfect way for me to apply my mathematical background by combining it with a lifelong passion for games.</p>
              <p>I also took it as an opportunity to pursue my artistic side. I taught myself numerous artistic tools alongside my programming development. I focused mainly on 3D work in blender and texturing using photoshop and krita, but also digital painting and concept art.</p>
              <p>The game engine is closed-source but I have screenshots and code examples of some of the things that I developed and learnt with this project.</p>

              <h2>September 2018 - Present</h2>
              <h4>C# Unity Game Developer & Game Artist (Personal Project)</h4>
              <p>After working on my game engine for a few years, I developed a vast skillset across a broad rangeof game development topics, but unfortunately, whilst my game engine is functional and working I had neglected to build an actual "game" with it (although that was always the idea.) It was at this point that I looked for alternative ways to prototype my game and to test the product idea. It was then when I came across Unity.</p>
              <p>I fell straight into Unity head-first and have immersed myself in it ever since. Unity came to me naturally, all of the knowledge of how game engines are built from the ground up made it incredibly easy for me to pick it up. I started with some of their simple tutorial projects but I am now working on my planned 3D Action RPG which is currently dubbed - Project Arclight.</p>
              <p>The game is still in-development but will continue as a hobby project, whilst I seek employment. The project is closed source, so just like the above project, I have included screenshots, code samples and written notes on the topics I have studied.</p>
